# PROBLEMS:
- MOBILE NOTIFICATION BAR IS OVERLAPPING WITH THE APP UI SPECIALY THE BUTTON PLACED ON THE TOP MOST OF THE APP
- PLAYLIST ARE NOT FULLY SHARED WITHIN THE APP (APP SHOULD STORE USER PLAYLISTS THEN BE ABLE TO USE IT IN BOTH HOST MODE AND GUEST MODE)
- ADD MORE RELIABLE OPTIONS TO SHARE/BACKUP PLAYLIST SPECIALLY FOR LARGE PLAYLISTS
